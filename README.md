<h1> Data driven sustainability </h1>

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am PhD Researcher using data analysis and systems modelling to better understand humanity's impact on the Earth. I have published my work in multiple Q1 scientific journals, contributed to European Commission reports, and presented my research across the world. All models used in my research are kept open-source and available for download in my github repositories. 

I am particuarly interested in analyzing the food, energy, and plastic waste systems at national and international scales. I explore how changes to these systems can be incoporated into society to evaluate and reduce the burden we place on planetary boundaries. I've largely carried out this work in academic institutes, in collaboration with intergovernmental institutes (Joint Research Center), and programmes such as the European Union's Climate Knowledge and Innovation Center.

**Examples of questions I like to explore inlcude:**

- _What role do diets play in moving towards a sustainable food system?_
- _How will plastic packaging bans on fruits and vegetables affect food and plastic waste? Will the reduction in plastic production and waste be offset or negated by increased food waste?_
- _How does trade affect our understanding of the role high-income countries play in plastic pollution?_
- _How do national food production policies affect food sufficiency and consumption patterns in countries?_
- _How would food system policies affect the impact of the food system?_
- _How can governments support a transition towards a circular economy?_

**Work Experience**
- Environmental Consulting - 2 years 
- Postgraduate academic research - 5 years

<h1> Personal interests </h1>

I am an avid basketball fan, closely following the NBA. On top of enjoying the sport, it also provides a unique integration of data analytics, creating the perfect environment to channel my personal and professional interests. I have spent some of my free time developing algorithms and scripts like predicting the winners of end-of-season awards or contextualizing unique historical feats. If the NBA or any NBA teams would like to collaborate, I'd be more than happy to do so.
