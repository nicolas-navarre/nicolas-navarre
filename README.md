Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am PhD Researcher using data analysis and systems modelling to better understand humanity's impact on the Earth. I have published my work in multiple Q1 scientific journals in addition to contributing to European Commission reports. All models used in my work are kept open-source and available for download in my github repositories.
